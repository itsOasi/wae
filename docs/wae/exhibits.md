# Exhibits

### Components
An exhibit is made up of components, which is pretty much a small bit of web code that is loaded when it appears in the exhibit file. 

Components can have a parent component and children components. Some components are containers that display other components in row, column, and grid formations, while others represent entire sections of the page.
