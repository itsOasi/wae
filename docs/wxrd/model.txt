The model is a system of tables holding entities and components.

The model can be initialized with a view, similar to exhibits in wae.

you can get a text overview of the data in the model with the peek function.

When interfacing with external systems, the freeze function exports all of the active data as a json string. 
The data shared is equivalent to that shared with the peek function, just in json format.
